  The Secret of Monkey Island is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Point-and-click_adventure_games">point-and-click adventure game</a> full of pirates, voodoo and oddball humour. You play as Guybrush Threepwood, a young man (with alledgedly fancy pants), trying to become a pirate on the fictional Caribbean island of Mêlée.
    
  Whilst attempting to undertake three pirate trials to earn acceptance as a filthy swashbuckler, Guybrush inadvertently uncovers a plot to kidnap the island's governor and clumsily tries to rescue her.
    
  But it's not just any scurvy pirates involved; the legendary Ghost Pirate LeChuck is the culprit! Guybrush will need more than a cheap t-shirt to defeat the infamous ghost and his haunted crew.
